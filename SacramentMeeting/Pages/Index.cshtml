    <h2>Sacrament Meeting Planner</h2>
    <h4>That thou mayest more fully keep thyself unspotted from the world, 
    thou shalt go to the house of prayer and offer up thy sacraments upon my holy day. D&C 59:9</h4>

    <p>Sacrament meetings last 60 minutes and are focused on deepening conversion to Heavenly 
    Father and the Lord Jesus Christ and strengthening faith in Them. Allowing the ordinance 
    of the sacrament to be the sacred center of members’ worship on the Sabbath requires careful 
    planning, including minimal announcements and consideration of speakers, hymns, and musical 
    numbers. Ward choirs may participate as local circumstances allow. Sacrament meetings begin 
    and end with a hymn and prayer. A hymn also precedes the blessing of the sacrament.</p>
